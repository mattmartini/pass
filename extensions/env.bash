Usage:

    $PROGRAM env [--exec=/bin/sh] pass-name
        Treat a given password-store entry as a set of key/value pairs,
       and make them available for use as environmental variables.

    Given an entry such as:

        username: bob
        password: steve
        email: user@example.com

    The expected usage would be something like this:

        source <(pass env Company/values.development)

    This will result in the export of three variables to the environment
    \$USERNAME, \$PASSWORD, and \$EMAIL.  It is assumed entries are colon-
    seperated, and keys are upper-cased for consistency.

    If you specify the --exec argument instead of echoing the values they
    will be set in the environment and then the specified program will be
    executed directly for example:

       pass env --exec=$HOME/bin/tool.cli Company/CLI/tool-name
_EOF
  exit 0
}

cmd_env_version() {
  echo $VERSION

    --exec) exec=$2; shift; shift ;;

  while read -r line; do

      # Only process lines with ": " or ":\t"
      if ( echo ${line} | grep --extended ":[ \t]" 2>/dev/null >/dev/null); then

          # Key is the first field, before the ":"
          # Make it upper-case
          key=$(echo $line | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr a-z A-Z)

          # Now ordinarily we could get the second-field by using
          # a similar approach:
          #
          #   awk -F: '{print $2}'
          #
          # However if the password/field contains colons then this
          # breaks.  For example:
          #
          #   Link: s3:https://example.com/#!hello
          #

          # Get the second field by deleting everything upto (inclusive) ': '
          pwd=${line#*: }
          # NB: this method allows spaces in the Notes field.

          # Empty execute?  Just echo, we assume we're being sourced.
